Our Scene
There is a city with a floating racetrack in it. On the racetrack is a controllable "car".
Above the car are two floating teapots one rotating around the other. See documentation for a better understanding with screenshots

there is a problem with the light functionality, the problem is that each mesh gets their own light when we add a light.
Due to time constraints we were not able to fix this problem.

bonus
add multiple lights that can be modified(0.5pt),
there are lights in a grid  and there is a "wave" of light that approaches during runtime.
