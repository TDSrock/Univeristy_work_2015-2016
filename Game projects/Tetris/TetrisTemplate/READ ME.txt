Hello this is student Sjors Gielen student number: 5558956

On the Tetris project we had planned to split up the components of the game. I had assisted my partner to quite large lenghts on her components of the game.
With that I was under the asumption that she would be able to complete her fair shair of the game. However about 36 hours before the deadline she sent me a text telling me that she did not understand how to work with Methods
and Classes leading to it being extremely difficult for her to comprehend what I did and how and how to complete her components.
She ultimatly gave me a copy paste of our previouse spagheti code game Poro Pong which was supposed to be the MenuState of the game. I looked at it and realised that, it woulden't even work properly(she missed some of the spagheti code's
crucial components), it was spagheti code itself.

As such I went into a mad scramble to attempt and complete the game on my own. I streamed almost all of the progress I made, as such the video footage is stored(so if this comes into question I can always prove it with the video's)
I ended up getting the PlayState completed.

The functions my partner made were
WelkeTet()
and
Tetdown()
Along with the Cooldown variable(which I later modified so it would become smaller over playtime)

Other then those two components of the game I wrote all of the game.

I hope that this is kept in consideration of your evaluation of the game.
